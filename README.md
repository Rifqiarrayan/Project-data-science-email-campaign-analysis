In the ever-evolving digital era, companies of all sizes-small, medium, and large-are striving to increase their customer base through various marketing strategies. One effective and measurable method is email marketing. Small companies may see email as a cost-effective way to reach potential customers, while medium and large companies can utilize email to run more complex and segmented campaigns.
However, the success of an email campaign is not always guaranteed. Factors such as email content, campaign type, email source, and subscriber characteristics can affect subscriber response. Therefore, it is important for companies to understand the elements that contribute to the success of their email campaigns. With this understanding, they can design more effective emails, increase engagement, and ultimately increase customer conversion and loyalty.
